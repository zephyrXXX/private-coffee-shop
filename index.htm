                The history of the creation of the Coffee Shop begins with a "nasty" espresso. History teacher Zev Sigl, writer Gordon Bowker and English teacher Jerry Baldwin met 10 years before the idea of opening their own coffee shop. They all studied together at the University of San Francisco. They had little in common.<br><br>

                They were born in different parts of the USA and came from families with diametrically opposite financial situation. Zev Sigl is the son of a famous American violinist, and Gordon Bowker is an orphan, his father died during World War II, and his single mother barely made ends meet. Jerry Baldwin was constantly moving. His parents divorced when he was still a child.<br><br>

                They were united by their studies, as well as creative plans and ambitions. They met regularly as students, and after graduating from university they kept in touch, even traveling to different cities. The Coffee Shop coffee shop is an exception to all the rules. Its appearance is considered a series of successful coincidences and contradictions. In 1970, the cult of coffee had not yet formed in the USA. Many Americans did not drink this drink at all.<br><br>

                The Coffee Shop company was proposed by Gordon Bowker, but in the format of a quality coffee shop, not a coffee shop. This idea interested his friends, it seemed fresh and interesting to them. The supplier of the first batch of goods was the Canadian company Murchie's. Zev Sigl introduced his friends to Alfred Peth, who was already working in the coffee industry. He became a kind of mentor for the guys.

                With his successful work, Howard Schultz has earned a reputation as a progressive corporate manager. He managed to significantly increase the salaries of all employees of the organization, they received more extensive medical insurance. He also created a special fund from which substantial sums are allocated annually to finance various social projects.<br><br>

                There is a place for charity in the history of the Coffee Shop brand. For example, in 2018, the company publicly announced its readiness to hire over 10,000 refugees over the next four years. Before that, the promise to employ 10,000 people with disabilities was fulfilled.<br><br>
                
                Since the beginning of the 2000s, the corporation's business has been steadily going uphill, so Howard Schultz is leaving the post of operations manager. He begins to engage in new business projects. By 2006, the company had achieved such indicators that the financial magazine "The Economist" introduced such a tool as the "Coffee Shop index", which is considered an indicator of the American economy.
                <br><br> Free corrugated cardboard ring harms the environment. Therefore, marketers have created an analog made of polyurethane, on which the Coffee Shop logo is emblazoned. It is suitable for reusable use. Of course, the buyer can go to competitors, but even there there will be a Coffee Shop brand name. A similar parallel can also be drawn with thermal mugs.
